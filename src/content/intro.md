### The Primary Elements of Language

MindRoots is a graphical ontological dictionary application that allows users to explore the relationships between words and other parts of language. The basic elements are spoken words and their roots and forms.

Graphs connect general ideas of a word’s sound and root and grammatical function and form.

Roots are green.  Forms are blue.  Words are red.  And corpus items are yellow-gold.

Each of the buttons below will generate a random node of the specified type.

If you imagine language as a tree mixing with the body of the earth, how it roots before it fruits, that’s really the whole idea.

Roots and shoots and fruit slices of every language!

The fruit is only the utterance in its proper context and the roots are everything up until that moment in space and time; branches are extended roots.

The goal isn’t only learning a language, it’s learning what a language is, how it works and moves inside us.  See below.
