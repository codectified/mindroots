## The Basics of Graphs

A unique feature of this tool is its use of a graph database to organize and represent language.  Graphs databases differ from traditional databases in that they more directly mirror natural structures, especially those involving many relationships and “end-to-end” connections, like a tree or a nervous system or an electron cloud.

The idea is to isolate a word’s essential **sound** and **root** and all it’s various **forms** and **grammatical functions**. 

These three components are color-coded throughout out this application:

- **Roots**: ![#008000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008000/000000?text=+) Green
- **Forms**: ![#0000FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF/000000?text=+) Blue
- **Words**: ![#FF0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF0000/000000?text=+) Red
- **Corpus Items**: ![#FFD700](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFD700/000000?text=+) Yellow-Gold

## Interacting with the Graph

Graphs are displayed when clicking on a word from the library, here in this getting started page, and in the sandbox mode.

The sandbox allows searching for roots by their radical letters.  You can specify one, two or three letters to see all matching roots.

Click a node to reveal its links and click it again to see additional information.

## Learning Language

The aim here isn’t only to learn a language but to understand what a language is, the process, and how it moves within us. Explore, connect, and discover below!

If you imagine language as a tree rooted deep in the earth, where it grows and branches before finally bearing fruit, this the visualized graph mirrors that structure and process.

(Note that due to the recent update of about 50000 Arabic words and 5000 roots, functionality here is very limited for English.  Most word nodes will not display a label if your primary language is set to English.)
