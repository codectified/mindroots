Words are the final form of language after it leaves our minds and escapes our lips.  

All words are made up of essential sounds and structure; a root and a form. 

Click the word once to see its root. 

Click the root again to see its form.

Feel free to try and guess first.

Roots are usually made up of three distinct sounds.

Forms require some knowledge of grammar and essentially equate to parts of speech but are more fine-grained. If you know the meaning of the word, then you can usually guess it’s grammatical function, even if you don’t know the technical name. 

The technical names are more useful when we want to look at patterns across multiple roots since the same word can have more than one grammatical form or function. 

And when we look at roots we’ll take a closer look at the relationships between different forms.
