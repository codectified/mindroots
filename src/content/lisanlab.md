## What is Lisān Lab?

Lisān Lab is a semiotic laboratory—a space where the dynamics of language are explored as living processes.  

It’s both methodology and manner--a structured, live approach to studying how language, meaning, and selfhood unfold together.  

In each session, we examine language while being very conscious of the fact that we are using language to do so—treating language not just as a system of signs, but as a mirror of the mind, the heart, the body, and the soul.  

Much like in psychoanalysis where we study the movement of thought, Lisān Lab is where we study the movement of meaning.  

The aim is not only to explore language theoretically, but to experience those moments of grounding and clarity where meaning blooms, frames shift, and understanding anchors into the self.  

It is an epistemological practice: not just studying language from the outside, but participating in its unfolding, becoming conscious of the deep structures that normally remain hidden beneath both our speech and much of our thought.  

Most practically, Lisān Lab is a series of one-on-one public conversations about language and meaning.

## Session Flow

These questions will guide each session:

- How do we know what we know here?
- What’s the basic idea? Translations? Related words or ideas?
- How do we know this idea is real?
- How would we explain it to a child?
- What’s the deeper meaning? What links the ideas? How are they framed?
  - Abstract vs Concrete
  - Process vs Essence
  - Separation vs Union
- What can we say about the general patterns here? The form?
- How do these patterns appear in specific contexts?

Throughout each session we will also demonstrate tools and tricks of the trade to expand meaning and improve learning and retention.

## Why This Conversation is Important

Lexicographers and scholars often document roots, forms, and patterns in language but rarely explain why certain words share a connection beyond linguistic mechanics.

Some etymological explanations exist, but others are left unexplored—requiring cognitive inquiry into meaning.

Meaning is not just a linguistic fact—it is a cognitive and experiential phenomenon that is best understood collectively through deep reflection and continuous discourse.

Only that’s what moves us and strikes the heart, grounding us and connecting us to whatever reality we choose.

The Qur’an emphasizes *tadabbur* (تدبر), deep deliberation—engaging with language as a living, active process.

These sessions supplement broader research efforts and contribute to the Mindroots linguistic database—helping to refine knowledge maps, or knowledge mapped in a structured, computational format.

This kind of inquiry is open to everyone, scholar and layman alike, because in dealing with something as fundamental as language, human experience itself becomes essential to gaining any insight into the process of language and the essence of the human condition—or at least our cognitive capacities.

Someone familiar with city life may find certain word relationships more intuitive than someone who grew up in rural settings, and vice versa. Likewise, someone with a historical, legal, or scientific background—or even a culinary background—might be more inclined to recognize certain patterns and connections than someone without that experience.

We all possess unique perspectives and can benefit each other by sharing our insights.

The study group is an effort to enrich our community and build a bridge between research and experience—where meaning is not just studied, but felt and observed as part of a broader whole.

Key items or “etyma” discovered in community sessions, as well as any other significant linguistic information, can all be recorded and used to enhance the Mindroots database. We’ll find the heart of a matter and its greatest beats.

## Research Background

These sessions and background research are not just about language or lexicography—they are part of research efforts which aim toward establishing a cognitive framework for understanding meaning across all domains.

In other words, a cognitive-linguistic theory of knowledge: any effort to understand how language works is an effort to understand how the mind works.
