# Welcome to MindRoots

Mindroots is a graph-based linguistic research tool for exploring the structure of language and meaning.	

Through deep investigation of linguistic structures, we find that meaning emerges in language just as it does in life:  through connection between root, form and context:

When the heart, mind and body are connected and in balance, the soul is born and we find meaning in the grand play of the self.

When they are disconnected, we are left with a body (or a corpus) and its parts—which we can study to better understand the whole.

And so, Mindroots is also a project rooted in a rigorous pedagogical effort to unify a cognitive-linguistic theory of knowledge, since such an effort is essentially part an parcel to education, learning and general self-development and growth.

### The Big Idea: Language mirrors the structure of the self and is the key to understanding the self in context. 

Every word has a root and a form—just as every person has both an external form and an internal essence. Understanding the connections within a language helps us identify the connections within ourselves.
