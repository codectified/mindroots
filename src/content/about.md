MindRoots is a project in cognitive science, linguistics and philosophy, at least.

We can only understand the mind and the self through language. 

If we can see language a little better, the process as a whole, we can probably see ourselves and our minds a bit better, too. 

Featured here as part of this project is a morphosyntactic semantic modeling tool for navigating a graph database of words and their interrelationships. 

For an interactive tutorial on navigating this visual database, check out this article on the basic elements language: [Introduction](/mindroots/introduction)

Or, dive right in and select a corpus from the library to view a detailed graph of any word in the corpus.

(data is limited in the current version!)



In the first phase of this project the focus is on the arabic language with english translation of the 99 arabic names of god. More language models and translations are planned. 

Currently, there are [XX] number of words, forms, roots.. in the lexicon database.

All words are connected through form and sound.  

Every word has a root.  Every word has a form.

Just as every person has an external appearance and an internal operation.

Just as in life, linguistic relationships stem from our dimensionality.

You can view these relationships in a graphical space.

Both the root and form of a word have different dimensions, let's take a look at a few examples.



### Translator’s notes:

The dictionary function of this tool is intentionally limited for the sake of providing a generalized picture of meaning as verb, as the process of language. 

Again, the goal here isn’t primarily to learn a new language.  The structure and process of language itself is the aim and focus.  

User-submitted usage examples and links are planned for future updates.

Nothing beats immersion for language acquisition, just like anything worthwhile. You might learn a word or even a line or two of poetry if you spend some time, but more than that you’ll likely have made many more conceptual connections.

Think of it as a way to imagine how ideas literally are life taking root in the mind:  where every sound fits into our system of sound and meaning.

Another, way to think about it is like a map of meaning tracing the movement from utterance to context, the physical manners and places of articulation all the way to the thoughts in our head, those we are aware of or not.

Because this is something of a point of controversy among some linguists and philosophers of the mind who contend that roots don’t exist in the mind and are only an academic convention or afterthought, we’re going to be extra careful with our language and not say anything about what is in the mind and what is not, nor what comes from what.

MindRoots is a graph database  illustrating how meanings form through relationships develop within language.  Words of the same root share essential meaning and words of the same form share a functional or operational meaning.

Roots like forms are not dead, inanimate conventions nor are they mystical coded meanings; they are a process of organization, a movement of meaning which ends with speech.

Hence, they are part of language.
