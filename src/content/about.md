# Welcome to MindRoots

MindRoots is a project that explores the intersections of cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy.

Less formally, it’s a graphical, ontological, etymonic database and dictionary, where **graphical** means the data is stored in a graph database. Graph databases closely mirror natural linguistic structures, allowing for an intuitive exploration of language.

## The Big Idea

The core idea behind MindRoots is that **life and language are deeply intertwined**—just as our hearts, minds, and bodies are interconnected, so too are the words, sounds, and meanings that make up our language.

Language is the key to understanding the mind and the self. By examining language more closely, we can gain deeper insights into our hearts and minds.

If we can see language as a whole process, we can better understand ourselves and our internal worlds.

### Explore the Database

Select a corpus from the library to view a detailed graphical representation of words and their relationships—through sound and form—to other words in the corpus and the entire lexicon.

For a hands-on introduction, check out our [Getting Started with Graphs](/mindroots/introduction) article—an interactive tutorial that guides you through navigating the database with real graphical examples.



The first phase of MindRoots focuses on the Arabic language and its Semitic tri-literal root system, beginning with the corpus of the 99 Names of God. More language models and translations are planned. 

**All words are connected through form and sound**. Every word has a root and a form—just as every person has both an external form and an internal essence. These linguistic relationships, rooted in dimensionality, are beautifully visualized in a graphical space.

Although due to graphical limitations we can't view the entire database at once, we can view parts of it.

Here we can see the 99 Names of God (yellow nodes) and the words (red) and roots (green) that have been linked to each name so far. We're about halfway through.

> ### Translator’s notes:
>
> The dictionary function of this tool is intentionally limited to provide a generalized picture of meaning as a verb, as the process of language.
>
> It's important to note that the primary goal of MindRoots isn't language acquisition. Rather, it aims to illuminate the structure and process of language itself, providing a broader understanding of how meaning is constructed and conveyed.
>
> User-submitted usage examples and links are planned for future updates.
>
> Nothing beats immersion for language acquisition, just like anything worthwhile. You might learn a word or even a line or two of poetry if you spend some time, but more than that, you’ll likely have made many more conceptual connections.
>
> Think of it as a way to imagine how ideas literally are life taking root in the mind—where every sound fits into our system of sound and meaning.
>
> Another way to think about it is like a map of meaning tracing the movement from utterance to context, from the physical manners and places of articulation all the way to the thoughts in our heads, those we are aware of and those we are not.
>
> Since this topic can be controversial among some linguists and philosophers of the mind, who argue that roots don’t exist in the mind and are only academic conventions, we’re going to be extra careful with our language. We won’t make claims about what exists in the mind and what doesn’t, nor about the origins of concepts.

> MindRoots is a graph database illustrating how meanings form and develop through relationships within language. Words of the same root share an essential meaning, while words of the same form share a functional or operational meaning.
>
> Roots and forms are not dead, inanimate conventions, nor are they mystical coded meanings; they are part of a **process of organization**, a **movement of meaning** that culminates in speech. Hence, they are an integral part of language.
