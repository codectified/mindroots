# Welcome to MindRoots

Mindroots is a graph-based linguistic research tool for exploring the deep structure of language and meaning.	
	•	The database is built using graph technology with core relationships being between words, roots, forms and corpus items, enabling deep linguistic and ontological analysis across contexts.
  •	It provides a visual way to explore meaning dynamically rather than relying on static definitions.
	•	QuranRoots is a future version of the current application which will focus strictly on Islamic texts, whereas the Mindroots application will have a broader scope.

Through deep investigation of languague we find that meaning emerges--from both our words and our actions--when we connect heart and mind, function and form, the root and the fruit--when we understand how we move from one idea to another, the structure and style of our constructions from the greatest stories, to our greatest lines, their every word, every syllable and every sound.

When the heart and mind are connected and in balance, the soul emerges.
When they are disconnected, we are left with a body and its parts—which we can study to better understand the whole.

Mindroots aims to support such an endeavor as precisely as possible.

As such, Mindroots is also a project rooted in a rigorous pedagogical effort to unify a linguistic theory of meaning and knowledge or a cognitive theory of language, since such an effort is essentially part an parcel to the self-development and growth, in any case.

Below is an example model of this parallel where we can equate the heart, mind body and soul as yellow and red, and the heart and mind as green and blue.

## The Big Idea

Language mirrors the structure of the self and is the key to understanding the heart, mind and body. 

Every word has a root and a form—just as every person has both an external form and an internal essence. Understanding the connections within a language helps us identify the connections within ourselves.

If we consider the metaphor of a "root word" we can think of language as a way to see how ideas are literally life taking root in the mind—where every sound goes through stages of meaning until it fruits meaning.

A Mindroots knowledge attempts traces that movement of meaning from sound to context, from the physical manners and places of articulation to the thoughts in our heads.

By connecting the sounds and meanings of words we map essential human experience to abstract ideas. The etymon or "root word" of candid in Latin is candidius meaning "white".  In Arabic a basic  example comes from one of the most common names of god, الرحمان الرحيم, the most merciful of all time and space.  This name consists of two words which share the same essential sounds: ر-ح-م or the root.

The word for mercy in Arabic is رَحْمَةٌ (ra7ma) and رَحَمٌ (ra7im) refers to a mother’s womb. What’s the connection?  While some words are linked in ways more which are more obvious than others, depending on your own experience and knowledge.

At this point we have to have a conversation.  Definitions put points in space, but it's context which connects them.  Enter Lisan Lab:
