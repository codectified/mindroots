## + <span style="color:red;">(Low Frequency)</span>

- **Color/Frequency Range**: Red / ~430–480 THz (terahertz)
- **Associated Musical Note**: A
- **Phonetic Vowel**: /u/ (“oo”)
  - **Formant Frequencies**: 
    - **F1**: 200-400 Hz (low due to the high back tongue position)
    - **F2**: 600-1,200 Hz (lower frequency due to the rounded lips and back position of the tongue)
- **Emotional Qualities**: Energy, power, grounding.
  - Red is associated with stability, strength, and a sense of being grounded. It feels energizing and forceful.

**Frequency Doubling and Energy Requirement**:

- **Doubling Frequencies**: 
  - The frequency of Red (A note) must be doubled multiple times to move up through the spectrum (from infrared to visible light and eventually to ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma ray).
  - Red starts low, so it will take several octaves of doubling to reach destructive energy levels.
- **Energy Increase**: 
  - Moving from visible red light to infrared and then beyond requires a significant increase in energy.
  - **Energy Required**: Each octave represents a doubling of frequency, which requires double the energy. To reach gamma-ray levels (which are at extremely high frequencies), you would need to double the energy over approximately 20-40 octaves depending on the starting point.
- **Red’s Journey**: It’s the longest, starting in the lower frequency range. It requires the most energy (in terms of cumulative doubling) to reach the same destructive point as green or blue/violet.

## + <span style="color:green;">(Mid Frequency)</span>


- **Color/Frequency Range**:  Green / ~510–540 THz
- **Associated Musical Note**: D
- **Phonetic Vowel**: /a/ (“ah”)
  - **Formant Frequencies**: 
    - **F1**: 500-800 Hz (higher due to the open mouth position)
    - **F2**: 1,000-1,200 Hz (mid-range frequency due to the back and open tongue position)
- **Emotional Qualities**: Hope, growth, balance.
  - Green is connected with growth, harmony, and balance. It represents stability in a vibrant and expansive way.

**Frequency Doubling and Energy Requirement**:

- **Doubling Frequencies**:
  - The frequency of Green (D note) is already in the mid-range, so fewer octaves of doubling are needed to reach ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray frequencies compared to red.
  - Green is in the middle, meaning it will require moderate energy increases to become destructive.
- **Energy Increase**:
  - Moving from visible green light to higher frequencies (like UV) requires moderate energy increases.
  - **Energy Required**: Approximately 10-20 octaves of doubling from the green frequency range to reach gamma-ray levels.
- **Green’s Journey**: It’s shorter than red’s journey but still significant. It requires moderate energy (in terms of cumulative doubling) to reach destructive points.

## + <span style="color:blue;">(High Frequency)</span>

- **Color/Frequency Range**:  Blue / ~580–770 THz
- **Associated Musical Note**: F or F♯/G♭
- **Phonetic Vowel**: /i/ (“ee”)
  - **Formant Frequencies**: 
    - **F1**: 200-400 Hz (low due to the close, front tongue position)
    - **F2**: 2,000-3,000 Hz (high frequency due to the fronted tongue position)
- **Emotional Qualities**: Wisdom, serenity, transcendence.
  - Blue/Violet represents depth, calmness, and transcendence. It is often associated with insight, peace, and spirituality.

**Frequency Doubling and Energy Requirement**:

- **Doubling Frequencies**:
  - The frequency of Blue/Violet (F or F♯/G♭ note) is already near the upper limit of the visible spectrum. Fewer octaves of doubling are needed to transition into ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray frequencies compared to red and green.
  - Blue/Violet has the shortest journey to becoming destructive.
- **Energy Increase**:
  - Moving from visible blue/violet light to UV requires less energy increase than the lower frequencies.
  - **Energy Required**: Approximately 5-10 octaves of doubling from the blue/violet frequency range to reach gamma-ray levels.
- **Blue/Violet’s Journey**: It’s the shortest, requiring the least amount of energy (in terms of cumulative doubling) to reach destructive frequencies.

## Conclusion:

- **Low frequencies** are grounded and takes the most energy to become destructive, making it stable but slow to transform.
- **Mid** is balanced and in the middle, requiring a moderate amount of energy to reach higher, more dangerous frequencies.
- **High** is the most transcendent and quickly transforms into higher frequencies, requiring less energy to become destructive, embodying both wisdom and intensity.
