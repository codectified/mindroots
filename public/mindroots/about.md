# Welcome to MindRoots

MindRoots is a project that explores the intersections of cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy.

Less formally, it’s a graphical, ontological database and dictionary, where **graphical** means the data is stored in a graph database and visualized with nodes and links. 

Graph databases closely mirror natural structures and allow for an intuitive exploration of language.

Although due to graphical limitations we can’t view the entire database at once, we can view parts of it.

Here we can see the 99 Names of God (yellow nodes) and the words (red) and roots (green) that have been linked to each name so far. We’re about halfway through.

## The Big Idea

The core idea behind MindRoots is that **life and language are deeply intertwined**—just as our hearts, minds, and bodies are interconnected, so too are the words, sounds, and meanings that make up our language.

Language mirrors the structure of the self and is the key to understanding the heart, mind and body. 

How?

**All words are connected through form and sound**. Every word has a root and a form—just as every person has both an external form and an internal essence. And so, understanding the connections language helps us identify the connections within ourselves.

Think of it as a way to imagine how ideas literally are life taking root in the mind—where every sound fits into our system of sound and meaning.

Another way to think about it is like a map of meaning tracing the movement from utterance to context, from the physical manners and places of articulation all the way to the thoughts in our heads, those we are aware of and those we are not.

By connecting the sounds and meanings of words we map essential human experience to abstract ideas. 

The basic example comes from Islam and one of the most common names of god, الرحمان الرحيم, the most merciful of all time.  This name consists of two words which share the same essential sounds: ر-ح-م.  This is what we call the root.


Detailed definitions can be found for each word, but that’s not necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the general meaning of the root and its related words.  We can look at more words which share the same root to expand the context and connect the dots, literally.


One word, unsurprisingly is the word for mercy in Arabic: رَحْمَةٌ (ra7ma).

But how do we understand this idea in any language?  Most people will think of actions and attitudes towards others. 

Let’s look at another related word from the root: رَحَمٌ which refers to a mother’s womb. What’s the connection?  While some words are linked in ways more which are more obvious than others, depending on your own experience and knowledge, in this case an explanation comes to us from god himself in the form of a prophetic narration:


Abdullah bin ‘Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:
“The merciful are shown mercy by Ar-Rahman. Be merciful on the earth, and you will be shown mercy from Who is above the heavens. The womb is named after Ar-Rahman, so whoever connects it, Allah connects him, and whoever severs it, Allah severs him.”


حَدَّثَنَا ابْنُ أَبِي عُمَرَ، حَدَّثَنَا سُفْيَانُ، عَنْ عَمْرِو بْنِ دِينَارٍ، عَنْ أَبِي قَابُوسَ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ “‏ الرَّاحِمُونَ يَرْحَمُهُمُ الرَّحْمَنُ ارْحَمُوا مَنْ فِي الأَرْضِ يَرْحَمْكُمْ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاءِ الرَّحِمُ شُجْنَةٌ مِنَ الرَّحْمَنِ فَمَنْ وَصَلَهَا وَصَلَهُ اللَّهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَهَا قَطَعَهُ اللَّهُ ‏”‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو عِيسَى هَذَا حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ ‏.‏
