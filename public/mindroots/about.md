# Welcome to MindRoots

MindRoots is a project that explores the intersections of cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy.

A bit specificly, it’s an advanced search tool leveraging a graph database and force graph visualizations for data navigation.

Graph databases are a little different from traditional databases and more closely mirror natural structures which allows for an intuitive exploration of language.

Think of your family tree or your social network or the way the dendridic arbors in your brain look like tree roots stretching and galaxies, or a cross section of cabbage.  


## The Big Idea

The core idea behind MindRoots is that **life and language are deeply intertwined**—just as our hearts, minds, and bodies are interconnected, so too are the words, sounds, and meanings that make up our language.


Language mirrors the structure of the self and is the key to understanding the heart, mind and body. 

**All words are connected through form and sound**. Every word has a root and a form—just as every person has both an external form and an internal essence. And so, understanding the connections language helps us identify the connections within ourselves.

Think of it as a way to imagine how ideas literally are life taking root in the mind—where every sound fits into our system of sound and meaning.

Another way to think about it is like a map of meaning tracing the movement from utterance to context, from the physical manners and places of articulation all the way to the thoughts in our heads, those we are aware of and those we are not.

By connecting the sounds and meanings of words we map essential human experience to abstract ideas.
