## Getting Started with Graphs

MindRoots is a graphical ontological database and dictionary currently featuring ~50k words and 5k roots imported from primarily from Lane's Lexicon and supplemented with additional translations and linguistic information.

#### Interacting with the data

Click a node to reveal its links and click it again to see additional information (only available for word nodes currently). 

Pan the graph by clicking or tapping and dragging.  Pinch fingers or scroll to zoom.

Graphs are displayed when:

- clicking on a word from the library
- pressing a word, root or form button on the explore page
- searching for specific root(s) 

Currently, the library only features the 99 names of Allah.

Each of the buttons on the start page generate random nodes of the specified type.  This is a good place to preview the data and features.

The sandbox allows searching for roots by their letters.  This is most useful if you're looking for something specific.  Currently you can only search by root, but you can specify one, two or three letters to see all matching roots.

#### Why Graphs?

A unique feature of this tool is its use of a graph database to organize and represent language.  Graphs databases differ from traditional databases in that they more directly mirror natural structures, especially those involving many relationships and “end-to-end” connections, like a tree or a nervous system or an electron cloud.

The idea is to isolate a word’s essential **sound** and **root** and all it’s various **forms** and **grammatical functions**. 

These components are color-coded using the three primary colors throughout out this application:

+ <span style="color:green;">Roots are green</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Forms are blue</span>
+ <span style="color:red;">Words are red</span>
+ <span style="color:gold;">And corpus items are gold</span> because they are the choice examples of speech and expression.

#### Learning Language

The aim here isn’t only to learn a language but to understand language, the process, and how it moves within us.
