## Getting Started with Graphs

MindRoots is a graphical ontological database and dictionary currently featuring approximately 50,000 words and 5,000 roots, imported primarily from Lane’s Lexicon and supplemented with additional translations and linguistic information.

### Interacting with the Data

Each of the three main pages—**Library**, **Explore**, and **Search**—allows you to interact with and visualize the underlying graph database in different ways:

- **Library:** View texts or corpora, and access the graph by clicking individual words. Currently, the library features the 99 names of Allah. Clicking a word from these corpora displays it as a node, allowing you to explore its links and related information.

- **Explore:** Generate random nodes from different categories within the database. 

- **Search:** Locate specific root nodes by entering one, two, or three radicals. This is useful for finding exact roots when you know their letters. Matching roots are then displayed as nodes in the graph for further inspection.

To explore the graph, click a node to reveal its links, and click it again to view additional information (available for word nodes at this time). You can pan the graph by dragging and zoom by scrolling or pinching.

#### Why Graphs?

A unique feature of this tool is its use of a graph database to organize and represent language.  Graphs databases differ from traditional databases in that they more directly mirror natural structures, especially those involving many relationships and “end-to-end” connections, like a tree or a nervous system or an electron cloud.

The idea is to isolate a word’s essential **sound** and **root** and all it’s various **forms** and **grammatical functions**. 

These components are color-coded using the three primary colors throughout out this application:

+ <span style="color:green;">Roots are green</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Forms are blue</span>
+ <span style="color:red;">Words are red</span>
+ <span style="color:gold;">And corpus items are gold</span> because they are the choice examples of speech and expression.
