## Getting Started with Knowledge Graphs

Mindroots leverages a graph database featuring approximately 50,000 words and 5,000 roots, imported primarily from Lane’s Lexicon and supplemented with additional translations and linguistic information.

Each of the three main pages—**Library**, **Explore**, and **Search**—allows you to interact with and visualize the underlying graph database in different ways:

+ <span style="color:gold;">And corpus items are gold</span> because they are the choice examples of speech and expression. It's usually where we start.

+ <span style="color:green;">Roots are green</span> and expand into + <span style="color:red;">words which are red</span>

+ <span style="color:blue;">Forms are blue span</span>  and wide variety of categories and can stem from either words or corpus items

## Interacting with the Data

- **Library:** View available texts or corpora, and access the graph by clicking individual words. Clicking a word from from any corpus displays the selected word in the database and related information.

- **Explore:** Generate random nodes from different categories within the database. 

- **Search:** Locate specific root nodes by entering one, two, or three radicals. This is useful for finding exact roots when you know their letters. Matching roots are then displayed as nodes in the graph for further inspection.

To explore the graph, click a node to reveal its links, and click it again to view additional information (available for word nodes at this time). You can pan the graph by dragging and zoom by scrolling or pinching.

## Global Settings

#### Display Mode

You can switch between a graph display and a tabular display anywhere in the application.

Graphs are a bit more useful if you want to see a lot of information at once and don't necessarily care about order.  Tables are better in the opposite case when you're interested in a specific set of data or are concerned about order.

#### Text Layout

When accessing the Library, you can switch the text layout from traditional prose to a line-by-line view.

#### Color-coding and Highlighting

When accessing the Library, you can highlight words by their type or use a freeform highlighter to highlight specific sections of a text, line by line.

By default word types are highlighting on all knowledge graphs and table views.

#### Context and Filter Control

You can also control data views by restricting the context to a specific text or by filtering for different node types.

#### Form Node Expansion Limit

Because form nodes have the largest number of links the limit slider allows you to control the view based on your display size.
