## Getting Started with Graphs

MindRoots is a graphical ontological database and dictionary currently featuring ~50k words and 5k roots imported from primarily from Lane's Lexicon and supplemented with additional translations and linguistic information.

#### Interacting with the data

Click a node to reveal its links and click it again to see additional information (only available for word nodes currently). 

Pan the graph by clicking or tapping and dragging.  Pinch fingers or scroll to zoom.

Graphs are displayed when:

- clicking on a word from the library
- pressing a word, root or form button on the explore page
- searching for specific root(s) 

Currently, the library only features the 99 names of Allah.

Each of the buttons on the start page generate random nodes of the specified type.  This is a good place to preview the data and features.

The sandbox allows searching for roots by their letters.  This is most useful if you're looking for something specific.  Currently you can only search by root, but you can specify one, two or three letters to see all matching roots.

#### Why Graphs?

A unique feature of this tool is its use of a graph database to organize and represent language.  Graphs databases differ from traditional databases in that they more directly mirror natural structures, especially those involving many relationships and “end-to-end” connections, like a tree or a nervous system or an electron cloud.

The idea is to isolate a word’s essential **sound** and **root** and all it’s various **forms** and **grammatical functions**. 

These components are color-coded using the three primary colors throughout out this application:

+ <span style="color:green;">Roots are green</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Forms are blue</span>
+ <span style="color:red;">Words are red</span>
+ <span style="color:gold;">And corpus items are gold</span> because they are the choice examples of speech and expression.

#### Learning Language

The aim here isn’t only to learn a language but to understand language, the process, and how it moves within us.

Immersion is the best tool for the task of language acquisition. Children's cartoons and media consumption in general are nearly as effective as moving to another country!  Knowledge of linguistic patterns also helps, and this tool can be used both to learn linguistic patterns and to quiz yourself on your knowledge of a language.

- **Example:** Arabic root "ك-ت-ب" (K-T-B)  
  - Words: "كَتَبَ" (kataba - he wrote), "مَكْتَبَة" (maktaba - library), "كَاتِب" (kātib - writer)

From the explore screen, you can test your knowledge of words, roots, and forms in a number of ways:

The simplest is just generating a random node of each type and asking yourself what you know. Can you read the script? If not, roots are probably the best place to start: you get three letters at a time, and you can adjust the script settings to see both scripts at the same time, or go back and forth between the two.

- **Example:** Generate random root "ع-ل-م" (ʿ-L-M)  
  - Words: "عِلْم" (ʿilmu - knowledge), "عَلَامَة" (ʿalāmah - sign), "عَالِم" (ʿālam - world/scholar)

If you can read but that’s all, you can expand the roots to see the different words with a common root and start to get a sense of the most common patterns across roots.

- **Example:** Root "ج-ل-س" (J-L-S)  
  - Words: "جَلَسَ" (jalasa - he sat), "مَجْلِس" (majlis - council), "جَالِس" (jālis - sitting), "يَجْلِسُ" (yajlisu - he is sitting), "اِجْلِس" (ijlis - sit down!)

Words are colored in shades of red indicating basic types—see if you can figure out what the colors mean.

Because of the regularity of the triliteral Semitic root system and the very low number of closed-class words (as opposed to English for example which is a combination of Latin, Greek with a Germanic base which consists of a large number of closed-class words.), you can quickly start to recognize patterns and even guess part or all of the meanings of words you’ve never seen before.

- **Example:** Root "س-ل-م" (S-L-M)  
  - Words: "سَلَام" (salām - peace), "مُسْلِم" (muslim - one who submits), "اِسْتِسْلَام" (istislām - surrender), "سَلِيم" (salīm - healthy/whole), "تَسْلِيم" (taslīm - submission)
- **Example:** Root "ك-ب-ر" (K-B-R)  
  - Words: "كَبِير" (kabīr - big), "أَكْبَر" (akbar - greater), "تَكْبِير" (takbīr - declaration of greatness), "كِبَار" (kibār - elders)

Just like in any language, we start to hear and see things repeating, and our brain memorizes those details very quickly.  We are constantly listening for indications of morphosyntactic structures and patterns to quickly discern meaning.

There are only a handful of very common forms in each languageand this tool features eight forms currently. You can find a full count of the main forms below. If you learn the meaning of one word and you know the meaning of common forms, then you can apply those forms to the root of the word to instantly expand your vocabulary.

- **Example:** Root "ح-م-ر" (Ḥ-M-R)  
  - Words: "أَحْمَر" (ʾaḥmar - red), "حِمَار" (ḥimār - donkey), "تَحَمَّرَ" (taḥammar - to blush), "حُمْرَة" (ḥumrah - redness)

This means at a certain level of fluency, you will know the form of any word, and you can look at a collection of words that share the same form and quickly identify the morphological pattern.

This is the mechanism of action in the acquisition of any language: cognitive pattern recognition. This is how we all learn any language.

At an advanced level of fluency, one will start to see larger patterns across and through the depth and breadth of a language. In much the same way that someone of great knowledge or culture or both strikes us as relatable and closer to more people.

- **Example:** Root "ر-ح-م" (R-Ḥ-M)  
  - Words: "رَحْمَة" (raḥmah - mercy), "رَحِم" (raḥim - womb), "رَحِيم" (raḥīm - compassionate), "رَحْمَن" (raḥmān - the most merciful)
  - **General meaning:** Connection to compassion and nurturing (mercy/womb relationship)
