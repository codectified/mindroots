# General Guidelines and Strategy for IT & IS Implementations 

## Orientation & Optimization

Effective technology implementation requires two general organization-level phases: 

1. **Orientation** — learning how an organization actually operates: its communication channels, authentication methods, and data storage.
2. **Optimization** — applying systems design and implementation expertise to streamline those operations and prepare for growth.

## Orientation & Mapping Core Systems

- **Communication**
  - Public-facing: website, social, newsletters.
  - Internal: email, chat, project tools.
  - External-private: vendors, partners, contractors.

- **Authentication**
  - Small orgs: multiple ad-hoc accounts, often just Gmail/WhatsApp → need password manager.
  - Mid orgs: fragmented systems, some MFA, inconsistent ownership.
  - Large orgs: SSO (Google/Microsoft), MFA, role-based access, formal onboarding/offboarding.

- **Data Storage**
  - Cloud drives (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox).
  - Application databases.
  - Local/shared servers (legacy).
  - Varies between asset-oriented (organized, backed up) and incidental (fragmented, cluttered).

## Optimization (Systems & Processes)

- Streamlining communication flows
- Securing and simplifying authentication
- Organizing and backing up data storage
- Aligning systems with team needs and growth

## Role & Value

I act as both facilitator and fractional CTO — clarifying how systems work, translating between leadership and operations, and identifying opportunities for smarter, more secure, and more efficient practices.
