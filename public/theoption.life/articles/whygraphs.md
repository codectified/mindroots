# Graph Technology as the "Natural" approach

## What is Graph Technology?  

Graph technology and graph databases offer an alternative solution to information storage and retrieval from the conventional approaches of either relational databases or lucene index-based systems. Graphs technology is unconventional generally because it offers no advantage in computational speed and performance. Instead, graphs are best suited for natural systems such as social networks, language and knowledge itself.

## Knowledge maps in the age of AI

Graph technology is especially important in the age of AI as the organizational advantages of a knowledge map stored in a graph database greatly improves the combined technologies of Generative AI and Information Retrieval. A well-designed knowledge infrastructure offers both a bird's eye view of domain knowledge and allows for easy access to detailed information through simple traversal of the graph structure.
