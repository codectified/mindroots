# About My Work and Motivations

## Philosophy, Learning and Graphs

At the core of my work is a belief that the way we store and structure knowledge should reflect the way we think. Human cognition is not linear — it’s relational, dynamic, and deeply contextual. Meaning spreads, bifurcates, and converges, and the most effective systems mirror that reality. That’s why graph-based approaches are central to my work: they allow us to model knowledge in a way that is both intuitive — easy to navigate and reason about — and easily generalizable across vastly different domains and scales.

This approach enables a generalist — or anyone with a deep understanding of teaching and knowledge transfer — to design systems that can span across entire organizations, industries, or fields of study while remaining simple to explore and understand. Whether mapping the structure of an organization, an industry, a community, or body of knowledge, graph architectures offer both the bird’s-eye overview and the fine-grained detail necessary to see how information moves and where it can be improved.

My work demonstrates this principle in practice. One example is my upcoming graph résumé, a project that reimagines a traditional CV as a living, interconnected map — showing not just positions and skills, but how they connect, evolve, and form a coherent narrative over time.
