### You have found theoption.life

A site dedicated to the only option ever worth taking while everything else takes from us: life; to live, to connect, to grow, to continuously grow and stretch your self outwards into the world; or, accept death, stagnation, and decay. 

Inside the body, the heart and the mind turn, and the soul is their union and account. That is the self and all its modes of expression and activation. And so, here we find that life is as language is, unfolding in different patterns, continuously expanding.  Generally, these patterns manifest as binaries which define our identity. We hunger so we find ways to eat.  We like to play but at some point we need to work.  We have to build connections to survive and we all thrive only when the links are strong and many.  In the end, we find that in life balance is better than indulgence or frugalityâ€”language again is no different. 

With every human enterprise we find that language is supreme. With work, we are [prosaic] and cite [references]. And when playing, we like to [explore new ideas] and [be poetic]. Sometimes, can we do both at the same time and produce something from the fruits of our labor, so throw products, programs, and projects in there, too.  The most recent of which can also be found here:
