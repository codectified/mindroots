### You have found theoption.life

A site dedicated to the only option ever worth taking while everything else takes from us: life; to connect, to grow, to stretch yourself; or, accept death, stagnation, and decay. 

Here you will find that life is as language is, unfolding from the center outwards in different patterns, stretching itself out.  Inside the body, there is the heart and the mind, and the soul collects them all together. That is the self and all its modes of expression and activation. Generally, these patterns manifest as binaries which define our identity. We like to play but we need to work, for example.  And usually in the end, we find that balance is better than indulgence or frugality. 

In any human enterprise we find that language is always supreme. With work, we are [prosaic] and cite [references]. And when playing, we like to [explore new ideas] and [be poetic]. Sometimes can we do both at the same time and produce something from the fruits of our labor, so throw products, programs, and projects in there, too.  The most recent of which and important can also be found here:
