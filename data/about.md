MindRoots is a graphical ontology and cross-linguistic dictionary.

Roots and shoots and fruit slices of every language!

If you can imagine language as a tree mixing with the earth of the body, how it roots before it fruits, the fruit being only the utterance in its proper context and the roots are everything up until that moment in space and time; branches are extended roots.

…more technically, this is a morphosyntactic semantic network model of language with graphical interface.  

In the first phase of this project the focus is the arabic language with english translation but more language models and translations are planned. 

Currently, there are XX number of words, forms, roots.. in the lexicon database.

All words are connected through form and sound.  You can view these relationships in a graphical space.

Word to root relationships look like this:
    
    
Word->root

If we expand the root, we see some more of its fruit, other words with the same primary sounds in the same order:

root->words

If we expand a word we see possible grammatical categories or forms of the word.

word->form

Finally, if we expand the form node we see the other words which share the grammatical form.

That’s one part you can generally always take

From the main menu, select from the list of corpora to view a detailed graph of any word in the corpus.

(data is limited in the current version!)

Graphs connect general ideas of a word’s sound and root and grammatical function and form.

Roots are green.  Forms are blue.  Words are red.  And corpus items are yellow-gold.

Translator’s notes:

The dictionary function of this tool is intentionally limited for the sake of providing a generalized picture of meaning as verb, as the process of language. 

User-submitted usage examples and links are planned for future updates.

The hope of this project is to provide a guide for navigating and learning language by understanding the most basic relationships between words.  Think of it as a way to imagine how ideas literally are life taking root in the mind:  where every sound fits into our system of sound and meaning.

Another, way to think about it is like a map of meaning tracing the movement from utterance to context, the physical manners and places of articulation all the way to the thoughts in our head, those we are aware of or not.

Because this is something of a point of controversy among some linguists and philosophers of the mind who contend that roots don’t exist in the mind and are only an academic convention or afterthought, we’re going to be extra careful with our language and not say anything about what is in the mind and what is not, nor what comes from what.

MindRoots is a graph database  illustrating how meanings form through relationships develop within language.  Words of the same root share essential meaning and words of the same form share a functional or operational meaning.

Roots like forms are not dead, inanimate conventions nor are they mystical coded meanings; they are a process of organization, a movement of meaning which ends with speech.

Hence, they are part of language.
